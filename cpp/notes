destructor:
	default is noexcept if certain conditions are met

vector:
	at checks size and throws out_of_range exception while operator[] doesn't check size and doesn't throw. But operator[] isn't declared noexcept
	value_type must be erasable. All standard library containers require that their element type satisfies Erasable.
	there is one specialization, vector<bool>
	It uses __compressed_pair to store end pointer and allocator. This is to take advantage of empty base optimization if allocator is default. Boost has compressed_pair class.
	Most modification functions such as push_back, pop_back don't invalidate ALL iterators, only a subset of them.
	Most modification functions such as push_back, insert, emplace_back, emplace take both lvalue reference type or rvalue reference type.
